                <p>
                  We collect your information for the safety of our users who use our platform and guests who book through Bharat Darshan to understand who we are accommodating at our partner properties, for the safety of staff. In addition, website user and guest data is collected for statistical purposes. We also collect our guests’ nationality, date of birth, gender, for statistical analysis purposes. When you visit our websites, we may automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet). We use IP addresses to help us manage our websites and to collect broad demographic information for analytical use. For reservations, we send guests confirmation emails and will therefore require your email address. Exceptions may occur in the case of us needing to contact previous guests in relation to post or lost property.
